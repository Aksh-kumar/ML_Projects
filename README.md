# ML_Projects
This repository contain 3 projects  Iris_Data_Analysis, Black Friday and Urban_Sound_Classification projects.
(classification problems using Basic ML algorithm)
1.Iris Data Classification: Given the numeric parameter
which the dataset contain are Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal
width, Petal length. Predict the classes based on these
parameter possible classes are Versicolor, Setosa and
Virginica.

(Regression Problem using ensemble approach)
2.Black Friday: The data set also contains customer
demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type,
stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product
category) and Total purchase_amount from last month. Now,
they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount.

(classififcation problems using deep learning)
3.Urban sound Classification: From datasets consists of
8000+ sound from 10 classes predict the class label in which
it belongs to.

Details of the process is mentioned in each IPython notebook and data of first 2 i.e iris and black friday present in repositoty section itself but for deep learning project data is present on https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0By0bAi7hOBAFUHVXd1JCN3MwTEU because of large volume.If any help assist is required you can directly mail me at resakash1498@gmail.com, I am happy to answer.
